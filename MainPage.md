# Use of scripts #

These scripts are very easy to use, but you must use them in order from 1 to the last to get full benefit. Currently they don't check for proper input. This is an issue that I'm working on, but if you're using kali then you probably know what to do even without these scripts. I made these so that, mainly, I wouldn't have to type constantly and remember what parameters are what. Then decided to upload them here.


# Making executable #

First thing to do after cloning my repos is to make them all executable.
Under the folder you've downloaded them to, select all of them with either CTRL+A or just use the mouse to select them all. To make them executable you right click, after selecting, and go to properties. Then to the tab labeled permissions. Click the box that says 'allow executing file as program' until it is a check mark. I believe that if you select multiple files you will have to click that box twice to get a full check, not just a minus sign.

# Details of use #

After you have made them all executable, double click, let's say, the first one. A dialog box pops up, click the box that says 'run in terminal'. This will be the interface for whatever script you chose. In each one that gathers info, usually the airodump scripts, it will, at the end, give you 120 seconds to copy the info to a text file. I recommend opening this text file before using the scripts. This will be a temp use file to copy/paste to and from.
